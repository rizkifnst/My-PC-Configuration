# My-PC-Configuration
<p>These are my PC configuration. I use Slackware for the operating system, Blackbox for the window manager, and Vim for the text editor.</p>

<p><b>1. Root0</b> This configuration is for the blackbox style. You can put it on /usr/share/blackbox/style/.
<br /><b>2. vimrc</b> This configuration is for Vim. We can put this configuration on ~/ and don't forget to rename it to be .vimrc.</p>
